ImageProcessing
===============

My first crack at image processing.

Please use the following image as input or something similar:
http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/golf-ball-in-the-tall-green-grass-on-a-resort-course-elite-image-photography-by-chad-mcdermott.jpg


I will work towards creating a program where contours or differences in the gradient of the image are used to identify objects, and also add the feature of where it counts how many golf balls there actually are. This will be a good stepping stone for moving to detecting divider lines on a road, stop signs, etc.
